          What is Meat-Free?
        </Text>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "left", lineHeight: "17px", marginTop: "10px" }}>
          Meat-free means that the food does not contain any meat, or
          ingredients derived from meat. However, it may contain some elements
          that people of certain diet do not consume, such as eggs, dairy /
          milk, or alcohol. Please refer to the details within each specific
          shop / deal for further information.

          How do KindMeal deals work?
        </Text>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "left", lineHeight: "17px", marginTop: "10px" }}>
          Restaurants create attractive deals within KindMeal, which you can
          obtain coupons for. Our coupons differ from other conventional deal
          sites in that you do not need to make any upfront payment at KindMeal,
          and you can easily present our LiveCoupon via computer, mobile or
          laptop without any print coupons. For restaurants that do not require
          advance reservations, you can even use the LiveCoupon immediately!
          After all, eating is an impulsive decision, right?
